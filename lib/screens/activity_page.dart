CalCOFI has been sampling since 1949 and is one of the worldâ€™s longest running, integrated ocean ecosystem sampling programs. While originally focused on questions related to sustainable fisheries, CalCOFI observations also inform questions related to integrated ocean management, renewable energy, offshore aquaculture, tourism, as well as marine spatial planning, all in the context of climate change. The CalCOFI community is a diverse network of people within various local, state, federal, and international organizations, who come together to share information, exchange ideas, and develop priorities for long-term monitoring in support of ecosystem and marine resource management and resilience in the California Current System.',

The goals of this application are to augment existing long term ocean observations off the coast of California by engaging local people in the collection of marine life data. This application is a participatory citizen science application that allows recreational ocean users to upload detailed information on marine species they caught or observed, including the image of the organism, the species name, time, and location. The data collected will be used to support research and management off the coast of California.',
